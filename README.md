# 🧠 SMARTMRI™ – Sovereign Modular Adaptive Recalibration Technology via Mixed Reality Immersion

> “Recalibrating the human mind through consciousness, connection, and code.”

---

## 🌍 Overview

**SMARTMRI™ (Sovereign Modular Adaptive Recalibration Technology via Mixed Reality Immersion)** is a next-generation neuroadaptive framework developed by **CYNKRONAI Neurotech Systems™**.  
It fuses **neuroscience**, **mixed reality**, and **ethical artificial intelligence** to pioneer new models of mental-health recovery and cognitive evolution.

SMARTMRI™ integrates immersive XR therapy, connectome-guided neuromodulation, and AI-driven feedback loops to promote sustainable recalibration of neural circuits associated with trauma, addiction, and emotional dysregulation.
